JSON views are statically compiled. You can disable static compilation if you prefer by setting `grails.views.json.compileStatic`:

[source,yaml]
grails:
    views:
        json:
            compileStatic: false

NOTE: If you disable static compilation rendering performance will suffer.

For model variables you need to declare the types otherwise you will get a compilation error:

[source,groovy]
model {
    Person person
}
json {
    name person.name
    age person.age
}
