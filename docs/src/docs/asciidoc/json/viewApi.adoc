All JSON views subclass the link:api/grails/plugin/json/view/JsonViewTemplate.html[JsonViewTemplate] class by default.

The `JsonViewTemplate` superclass implements the link:api/grails/plugin/json/view/api/JsonView.html[JsonView] trait which in turn extends the the link:api/grails/views/api/GrailsView.html[GrailsView] trait.

Thanks to these traits several methods and properties are available to JSON views that can be used to accomplish different tasks.

==== Creating Links

Links can be generated using the `g.link(..)` method:

[source,groovy]
json.person {
    name "bob"
    homepage g.link(controller:"person", id:"bob")
}

The `g.link` method is similar to the equivalent tag in GSP and allows you to easily create links to other controllers.

==== Altering the Response Headers

To customize content types and headers use the `response` object defined by the link:api/grails/views/api/HttpView.html[HttpView] trait:

[source,groovy]
response.contentType "application/hal+json"
response.header "Token", "foo"
json.person {
    name "bob"
}

The `HttpView` trait defines a variety of methods for inspecting the request and altering the response. 

NOTE: The methods available are only a subset of the methods available via the `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` objects, this is by design as view logic should be limited and logic performed in the controller instead. 

==== I18n & Locale Integration

You can lookup i18n messages use the `g.message` method:

[source,groovy]
json.error {
    description g.message(code:'default.error.message')
}

You can also create locale specific views by appending the locale to view name. For example `person_de.gson` for German or `person.gson` for the default.

NOTE: For more complex message lookups the `messageSource` property is an instance of the Spring https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/MessageSource.html[MessageSource] class.
